# The Parents and Baby Book

This is a collection of notes and resources for parents and caregivers of babies. It includes information on baby care, development, and parenting tips.

The goal is to provide food for thought and a starting point for further research, but we do our best to provide as much scientific research as possible.

The information is not exhaustive and should not be taken as medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any concerns regarding your baby's health or development.
