# Mother's Milk


## Consumption of Mother's Milk

Infants usually consume about 0.5 kg/day of mother's milk for the first month and gradually grow to roughly 0.8 kg/day in the fourth month[@da-Costa2010-bk].


## Storing Mother's Milk

At room temperature (~ 25°C), up to 4 hours[^cdc_breast_milk][^nhs_breast_milk]. CDC provides a nice info-graphic for storing breast milk[^cdc_storage_info].
