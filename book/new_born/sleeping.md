Full term infants sleep about 70% of the time[@Barbeau2017-sf]. There are different sleep stages:

- Quiet sleep;
- Active sleep;
- Transitional Sleep.

## Bed

!!! tip ""

    We use this [[products/maxi_cosi_iora_air_bed|Maxi Cosi Iora Air]] bed for the baby. We move it to the living room during the day and to the bedroom at night.

## Evenings

### Lights

!!! tip ""
    We realized that our lights might be a bit too bright for the baby. So we dimmed all our ceiling lights and changed other lamps to warm or reddish color.

    We use this [[products/cotabaty_baby_night_light|Cotabaty Baby Night Light]] to check the baby during the night.
