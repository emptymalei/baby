# Feeding a New Born

## Breastfeeding

There are a lot of advocates for Breastfeeding in Germany. You will meet these people at every stage of your pregnancy and after the birth of your child.

!!! note "Communication and Support"

    Some of these advocates will push very hard and make you uncomfortable even suffer. However, most of time, they will offer you help by providing alternatives or different techniques to make it easier for you. Please remember to communicate clearly with them.

Apart from the close contact with your baby, breastfeeding of course provides [[new_born/mothers_milk|Mother's Milk]]. On the other hand, there are methods to extract milk from your breast and processes to help your nipples heal.
