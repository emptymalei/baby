# Feeding a New Born

## Breastfeeding

There are a lot of advocates for Breastfeeding in Germany. You will meet these people at every stage of your pregnancy and after the birth of your child.

!!! note "Communication and Support"

    Some of these advocates will push very hard and make you uncomfortable even suffer. However, most of time, they will offer you help by providing alternatives or different techniques to make it easier for you. Please remember to communicate clearly with them.

Apart from the close contact with your baby, breastfeeding of course provides [[new_born/mothers_milk|Mother's Milk]]. On the other hand, there are methods to extract milk from your breast and processes to help your nipples heal.

### Nipple Pain

The hospital provided us with a lotion called [[products/hpa_lanolin_lansinoh|"HPA Lanolin"]].

    In some hospitals, for example, [[facilities/koeln_hohenlind|St. Elisabeth-Krankenhaus Köln-Hohenlind]] in Cologne, offer laser treatment for your nipples. This is a very good option if you have sore or cracked nipples.

    If you are interested in the technical details of the laser treatment, you can read about it in the following article [@effectiveness_cirico_2021] [@nuts_chung_2012],

!!! info "Choose a Good Fabric for Your Clothes/Pajamas"

    Sometimes the [[products/vienna_breastfeeding_donut|Vienna breastfeeding donut]] doesn't help and made the nipple pain worse.

    But we found some clothes made from some specific fabrics are comfortable for the nipples:

    - Modal textiles.

    The following are fabrics that we found is causes irritation to the nipples:

    - Cotton.


## Milk Extraction

In Germany, you can get a prescription for a breast pump and the insurance will pay for it.

The one we got from the prescription was the [[products/medela_symphony|Medela Symphony Milk Pump]].


## Bottle Feeding

We use the [[products/philips_avent_bottle|Philips Avent Bottle]] for bottle feeding.

Washing bottles is a pain. Luckily [[products/baby_brezza_bottle_washer_pro|Baby Brezza Bottle Washer Pro]] saved us a lot of time and effort.

## Formula Milk

We also use formula milk. We have tried the following brands:

- [Aptamil](https://www.aptaclub.de/)
- [Hipp](https://www.hipp.de/)
- [Neocate](https://www.neocate.de/)

All are fine. We decided to go with the [[products/neocate_infant|Neocate Infant]] because our hospital provided it and our baby liked it. Personally, we don't feel any difference between the three brands.
