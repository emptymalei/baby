### Poop Wheels and Palettes

There are different versions of the so-called "Poop Wheel". One of the most popular ones is the one from [The Bump](https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-poop). It is a wheel that shows the different types of poop your baby can have [^bump_poop_wheel].

??? info "Other Versions and Sources"

    Copley Hospital also have a hand-drawn version of it[^copley_poop_wheel]. It is hard to trace which was the original version of the poop wheel. There are also versions with different visualizations such as palettes[^cleveland_clinic_poop_palette].

    It is not easy to get the original research papers as there are no references mentioned in the chart.
