# New Born

It was quite confusing the first time I interacted with our new born.

## Choose Your Tracking Method

We can't emphasize enough how important it is choose a convenient method to track your new born's activities. People may have great memories but it becomes really hard when we experience sleep deprivation.

!!! tip "Baby Daybook App"

    We use the [[products/baby_daybook|Baby Daybook]] app. It is absolutely nailing the tracking of our new born's activities.


## Trustworthy Sources of Information



!!! tip "Pathways.org"

    We find the website [[products/pathways_org|Pathways.org]] quite useful.
