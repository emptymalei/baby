We use the Bugaboo Fox 5 series. It has a stroller set and a car seat.

We purchased it at their [official website](https://www.bugaboo.com/de-de/kinderwagen-sets/fox-5/bugaboo-fox-5-kinderwagen-3-in-1-set-BP10020.html).

Their car seat has a lot of padding and a shade to protect the baby from the sun. We really love it.

The stroller is also very flexible. It has large wheels so the bobbing is reduced on uneven surfaces.
