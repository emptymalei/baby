We use the Baby Brezza Formula Pro Advanced as to make supplemental formula for our baby. It is an absolute life saver.

We got it from [the official Baby Brezza website](https://www.babybrezza.de/products/formula-pro-advanced), but you can also find it on Amazon and other retailers.

We also recommend to get an extra Trichterset:
