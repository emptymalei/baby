# Philips Avent Natural Baby Bottle

Our midwife recommended the Philips Avent Natural Baby Bottle. We use it for both breast milk and formula. It is easy to clean and has a wide neck for easy filling.

Our midwife recommended the nipple with the size 1 hole. But we could not find it in DM Supermarket. So we had to [buy from Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BWFMMPPC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1).
