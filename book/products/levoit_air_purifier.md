We bought the [Vital 200S](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BRXVMQT6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1). It is quite and sensitive enough to automatically adjust the power to purify the air.

For example, when we change the bedsheets, small particles are released into the air. Our baby would sneeze. But the air purifier immediately detects the drop in air quality and increases the power.
