              pregnancy, even after increasing dietary fibre and fluids. Are
              there any safe treatments I can recommend to them? ANSWER:
              Although the recommended first-line therapy for constipation
              includes increasing fibre, fluids, and exercise, these are
              sometimes ineffective. Therefore, laxatives such as bulk-forming
              agents, lubricant laxatives, stool softeners, osmotic laxatives,
              and stimulant laxatives might be considered. Although few of the
              various types of laxatives have been assessed for safety in
              pregnancy, they have minimal systemic absorption. Therefore, they
              are not expected to be associated with an increased risk of
              congenital anomalies. However, it is recommended that osmotic and
              stimulant laxatives be used only in the short term or occasionally
              to avoid dehydration or electrolyte imbalances in pregnant women.",

               during pregnancy. Hypertensive disorders are one of the major
               causes of pregnancy-related maternal deaths in the United States.
               We will present a comprehensive update of the literature
               pertinent to hypertension in pregnancy. The paper begins by
               defining and classifying hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. The
               normal vascular and renal physiological changes which occur
               during pregnancy are detailed. We will summarize the intriguing
               aspects of pathophysiology of preeclampsia, emphasizing on recent
               advances in this field. The existing diagnostic tools and the
               tests which have been proposed for screening preeclampsia are
               comprehensively described. We also highlight the short- and
               long-term implications of preeclampsia. Finally, we review the
               current management guidelines, goals of treatment and describe
               the potential risks and benefits associated with various
               antihypertensive drug classes. Preeclampsia still remains an
               enigma, and the present management focuses on monitoring and
               treatment of its manifestations. We are hopeful that this in
               depth critique will stimulate the blossoming research in the
               field and assist practitioners to identify women at risk and more
               effectively treat affected individuals.",
