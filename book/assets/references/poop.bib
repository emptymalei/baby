               of healthy infants up to 17 weeks of age. We included 1052
               healthy term infants from the prospective HELMi cohort
               (NCT03996304). Parents filled in recurring online questionnaires
               on feeding, gastrointestinal function, and crying weekly for the
               first 17 weeks of life. Defecation frequency was highest at the
               age of 3 weeks (a median of 4 times/day, interquartile range
               (IQR) 2.9-5). At each time point, the median defecation frequency
               of breastfed infants was higher than that of infants receiving
               formula (e.g., at week 17 a median of 2 times/day, IQR 0.9-3.6,
               and a median of 1.1, IQR 0.6-1.4, respectively). The dominant
               color of the stool was most often yellow or light brown. Nearly
               black stools were reported in the first week of life in 3.4\%.
               Nearly half (47.4\%) of the infants had green stool color
               dominating for at least 1 week, with comparable frequency among
               breastfed (47.7\%) and formula-fed (45.2\%) infants. Green stools
               were associated with a higher defecation frequency (linear
               mixed-effect model p < 0.0001). Occasional blood in stool was
               reported in 9.3\% and recurrent blood in 5.2\% of the infants
               with no difference in stool consistency. Hard stools were rare (≤
               1\%). Conclusion: This study enlightens the spectrum of
               defecation patterns in healthy term infants during the first 17
               weeks of life. A better understanding of bowel function helps
               healthcare professionals distinguish normal from abnormal when
               addressing defecation, the color of stools, and the type of
               feeding. What is Known: • Breastfed infants have more frequent
               and more yellow-colored stools than formula-fed infants. • Stools
               with green color are often suggested by the parents or even by
               medical professionals to indicate disease or discomfort in early
               life. What is New: • Nearly half of the healthy term infants had
               green stool dominating for at least one week during the first 17
               weeks and occasional blood was reported in almost 10\% of the
               infants during this period. • Data on normal variation in bowel
               function and stool may serve primary health care professionals
               when educating the families and caretakers of infants.",
