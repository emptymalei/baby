  abstract  = "The WHO has developed new growth curves based on breast-fed
               infants. Recommendations for energy intake have been adopted
               based on measurements of total energy expenditure. Data on human
               milk (HM) intake are needed to estimate the energy intake from
               this food source. However, objective HM data from around the
               world have not been available, because these measurements are
               difficult to obtain. Stable isotope methods have been developed
               to provide objective measurements over a 14-d period. A pooled
               analysis of 1115 data points of HM intake, obtained using the
               dose to the mother deuterium oxide turnover method, was
               undertaken in infants aged 0-24 mo from 12 countries across 5
               continents. A hierarchical model was needed to estimate mean HM
               intake and its variance within and between countries given the
               complexity of the data. The overall mean HM intake was 0.78 (95\%
               CI = 0.72, 0.84) kg/d, and the age-specific estimates indicated
               that intake increased over the first 3-4 mo and remained above
               0.80 kg/d until 6-7 mo. The variability of intake increased in
               late infancy. Boys consumed 0.05 kg/d more than girls (P < 0.01).
               HM intake was strongly, inversely associated with non-HM water
               intake [r = -0.448 (95\% CI -0.511 to -0.385); P < 0.0001]. These
               objective isotope values of HM intake improve our understanding
               of the magnitude and variability of HM intake within and across
               populations and help to estimate nutrient intakes in breast-fed
               infants.",
