              understanding sleep in the fetus, the preterm neonate and the term
              neonate. Sleep appears to have numerous important roles,
              particularly in the consolidation of new information. The sleep
              cycle changes over time, neonates spend the most time in active
              sleep and have a progressive shortening of active sleep and
              lengthening of quiet sleep. Additionally, the sleep cycle is
              disrupted by many things including disease state and environment,
              and the amplitude integrated EEG can be a useful tool in
              evaluating sleep, and sleep disturbances, in neonates. Finally,
              there are protective factors for infant sleep that are still being
              studied.",

               most of their day sleeping, making it paramount to place emphasis
               on adequate and optimal sleep. As the current body of literature
               continues to expand, we have increased our understanding of sleep
               and its role in development. Sleep disturbances, particularly
               early in life can affect all aspects of health such as
               neurological development, emotional well-being, and overall
               growth. This article aims to provide a primer on sleep
               development from fetal life into the neonatal period, discuss
               sleep in both the home and hospital settings, explore the tools
               used to measure sleep, and review common interventions applied to
               those infants experiencing poor sleep. Lastly, there is a mention
               of long-term outcomes and how early recognition and
               implementation of measures could help to improve overall growth

  abstract  = "Infant sleep undergoes dramatic evolution during the first year
               of life. This process is driven by underlying biological forces
               but is highly dependent on environmental cues including parental
               influences. In this review the links between infant sleep and
               parental behaviors, cognitions, emotions and relationships as
               well as psychopathology are examined within the context of a
               transactional model. Parental behaviors, particularly those
               related to bedtime interactions and soothing routines, are
               closely related to infant sleep. Increased parental involvement
               is associated with more fragmented sleep. Intervention based on
               modifying parental behaviors and cognitions have direct effect on
               infant sleep. It appears that parental personality,
               psychopathology and related cognitions and emotions contribute to
               parental sleep-related behaviors and ultimately influence infant
               sleep. However, the links are bidirectional and dynamic so that
               poor infant sleep may influence parental behaviors and poor
               infant sleep appears to be a family stressor and a risk factor
               for maternal depression.",

               or computer analyses. EEG patterns and their relationship to
               other physiologic signals serve as templates for normal brain
               organization and maturation, subserving multiple interconnected
               neuronal networks. Interpretation of serial EEG-sleep patterns
               also helps track the continuity of brain functions from
               intrauterine to extrauterine time periods. Recognition of the
               ontogeny of behavioral and electrographic patterns provides
               insight into the developmental neurophysiological expression of
               neural plasticity. Sleep ontogenesis from neonatal and infancy
               periods documents expected patterns of postnatal brain
               maturation, which allows for alterations from genetically
               programmed neuronal processes under stressful and/or pathological
               conditions. Automated analyses of cerebral and noncerebral

               phenotypes of brain organization and maturation in healthy or
               diseased states. Research pertaining to the developmental origins

               design longitudinal studies for the assessment of
               gene-environment interactions. Computational strategies may

               infants from birth to 1 year of age and to assess the association
               between such arrangements and maternal characteristics. METHODS:
               Responses to the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month questionnaires from the
               Infant Feeding Practices Study II were analyzed to assess sleep
               arrangements, including bed sharing, the latter defined as mother
               ever (in a given time frame) slept with the infant on the same
               sleeping surface for nighttime sleep. Women were also asked about
               the reasons for bed sharing or not bed sharing. RESULTS:
               Approximately 2300 women responded at 3 months, and 1800 at 12
               months. At 3 months, 85\% of the infants slept in the same room
               as their mother, and at 12 months that rate was 29\%. At 3
               months, 26\% of the mothers did not use the recommended supine
               position for their infant's nighttime sleep. The rate of
               noncompliance increased to 29\% by 6 months and 36\% by 12
               months. The bed-sharing rates were 42\% at 2 weeks, 34\% at 3
               months, and 27\% at 12 months. Approximately two thirds of those
               who bed shared with their infant also shared the bed with their
               husband or partner, and 5\% to 15\% shared it with other
               children. The major reasons for bed sharing were to calm a fussy
               infant, facilitate breastfeeding, and help the infant and/or
               mother sleep better. The major reasons for not lying down with
               the infant were safety concerns. Non-Hispanic black mothers were
               more likely than non-Hispanic white mothers to use nonsupine
               infant sleep positions and to bed share. CONCLUSIONS: More than
               one third of the women in this cohort were noncompliant with
               safe-sleeping guidelines when their infant was 3 months old.
               Health care providers need to advise parents of current
               recommendations and discuss the risks and benefits of their
               choices for infant sleeping practices.",
