# Giving Birth in a Hospital

## Call an Ambulance

Confirm with your gynecologist or midwife to see if and when you need to call an ambulance.

## Family Room

Ask for a family room. Some hospitals can even convert normal rooms into family rooms ([[facilities/koeln_hohenlind|St. Elisabeth-Krankenhaus KÃ¶ln-Hohenlind]] did this for us.).

## Discharge

Hospitals in Germany usually discharge mothers and babies in a few days.
