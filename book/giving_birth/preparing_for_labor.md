A few topics need to be addressed before you go into labor.

## General Tips

!!! tip "Some General Tips"

    - [ ] Create a shared calendar for the baby and add dates to the calendar so that you and your partner can manage and see the events. We use [[products/google_calendar|Google Calendar]].

## Hospital Checklist

There is no need to stress out about the hospital. Our experience with the hospital ([St. Elisabeth-Krankenhaus Köln-Hohenlind](https://www.hohenlind.de/)) was very positive. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The whole process was so smooth that we didn't even need to worry about or thinking about what we need to do. The hospital staff always reminded us on the next steps. And they all speak English.

!!! tip "Checklist for Hospital"

    === "Before Labor"

        - [ ] Contact and register with the hospital.

            !!! tip ""
                The hospital planned with us the dates and processes. Remember to write down these dates on your calendar.

        - [ ] Pack your hospital bag.
            - [ ] Find a list that is suitable for your hospital. You can find ours below this checklist.
            - [ ] Make sure you have all your important documents sorted out and reachable. This can help you speed up the process of getting into the hospital.

    === "After Labor"

        - [ ] Birth registration.



??? info "What's in our hospital bag?"

    We packed the following in a suitcase. It was a correct decision because we had to move among different rooms in the hospital.

    - [ ] Clothes
        - [ ] Comfortable clothes for yourself

            !!! tip ""
                If you decide to breastfeed, pack some cloth that is soft and doesn't irritate your skin. See the section on [[new_born/new_born_feeding#nipple-pain|Breastfeeding>Nipple Pain]] for more information.

        - [ ] Clothes for the baby

            !!! tip ""
                Apart from the normal clothes, pack something that can allow your baby to go outside. We had to take the baby to a different location for checkups so we ==needed a hat==.

    - [ ] Toiletries
        - [ ] Toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, ...
        - [ ] Shampoo etc
        - [ ] Bathrobe, slippers, and towel
    - [ ] Water bottle that allows easy drinking when lying down.

        !!! tip ""
            We used this [[products/klean_kanteen_bottle|Klean Kanteen]] bottle.

    - [ ] Phone charger
    - [ ] Cash!

        !!! tip ""
            For us, we needed ==cash for the birth registration== at the hospital. They didn't accept cards.

    We packed our documents in a separate small bag since we still needed to use them before we went to the hospital.

    - [ ] Important documents
        - [ ] ID card
        - [ ] Health insurance card
        - [ ] Mutterpass
