              understanding sleep in the fetus, the preterm neonate and the term
              neonate. Sleep appears to have numerous important roles,
              particularly in the consolidation of new information. The sleep
              cycle changes over time, neonates spend the most time in active
              sleep and have a progressive shortening of active sleep and
              lengthening of quiet sleep. Additionally, the sleep cycle is
              disrupted by many things including disease state and environment,
              and the amplitude integrated EEG can be a useful tool in
              evaluating sleep, and sleep disturbances, in neonates. Finally,
              there are protective factors for infant sleep that are still being
              studied.",

               most of their day sleeping, making it paramount to place emphasis
               on adequate and optimal sleep. As the current body of literature
               continues to expand, we have increased our understanding of sleep
               and its role in development. Sleep disturbances, particularly
               early in life can affect all aspects of health such as
               neurological development, emotional well-being, and overall
               growth. This article aims to provide a primer on sleep
               development from fetal life into the neonatal period, discuss
               sleep in both the home and hospital settings, explore the tools
               used to measure sleep, and review common interventions applied to
               those infants experiencing poor sleep. Lastly, there is a mention
               of long-term outcomes and how early recognition and
               implementation of measures could help to improve overall growth
               and development throughout childhood. [Pediatr Ann.
