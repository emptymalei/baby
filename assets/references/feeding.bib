               infants. Recommendations for energy intake have been adopted
               based on measurements of total energy expenditure. Data on human
               milk (HM) intake are needed to estimate the energy intake from
               this food source. However, objective HM data from around the
               world have not been available, because these measurements are
               difficult to obtain. Stable isotope methods have been developed
               to provide objective measurements over a 14-d period. A pooled
               analysis of 1115 data points of HM intake, obtained using the
               dose to the mother deuterium oxide turnover method, was
               undertaken in infants aged 0-24 mo from 12 countries across 5
               continents. A hierarchical model was needed to estimate mean HM
               intake and its variance within and between countries given the
               complexity of the data. The overall mean HM intake was 0.78 (95\%
               CI = 0.72, 0.84) kg/d, and the age-specific estimates indicated
               that intake increased over the first 3-4 mo and remained above
               0.80 kg/d until 6-7 mo. The variability of intake increased in
               late infancy. Boys consumed 0.05 kg/d more than girls (P < 0.01).
               HM intake was strongly, inversely associated with non-HM water
               intake [r = -0.448 (95\% CI -0.511 to -0.385); P < 0.0001]. These
               objective isotope values of HM intake improve our understanding
               of the magnitude and variability of HM intake within and across
               populations and help to estimate nutrient intakes in breast-fed
               infants.",

  abstract  = "Vitamin D deficiency has been widely reported in all age groups
               in recent years. Rickets has never been eradicated in developed
               countries, and it most commonly affects children from recent
               immigrant groups. There is much evidence that current vitamin D
               guidelines for the neonatal period, 5-10 microg (200-400 IU)/day,
               prevent rickets at the typical calcium intakes in developed
               countries. The annual incidence of vitamin D-deficiency rickets
               in developed countries ranges between 2.9 and 7.5 cases per
               100,000 children. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in
               mothers and their neonates is remarkable, and the results of one
               study suggest that third-trimester 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)
               is associated with fetal bone mineral accrual that may affect
               prepubertal bone mass accumulation. Beyond infancy, the evidence
               indicates that 5 microg (200 IU)/day of vitamin D has little
               effect on vitamin D status as measured by the serum 25(OH)D
               concentration. Two randomized clinical trials show that higher
               vitamin D intake improves one-year gain in bone density in
               adolescent girls. The functions of vitamin D extend beyond bone
               to include immune system regulation and anti-proliferative
               effects on cells. Early life vitamin D inadequacy is implicated
               in the risk of bone disease, autoimmune disease, and certain
               cancers later in life; however, long-term interventional studies
               do not exist to validate the widespread implementation of greater
               vitamin D consumption. Here we review the available data
               concerning vitamin D status and health effects of vitamin D in
               pregnancy through to and including adolescence.",
